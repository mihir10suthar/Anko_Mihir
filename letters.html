<div class="letter">

<h2>Letter One</h2>
<p>
Ankita,<br><br>
I don’t know when it happened exactly, but somewhere between our conversations,
our silences, and the way you unknowingly became part of my everyday thoughts,
you turned into someone my heart recognizes as home. Loving you was never loud
or dramatic. It was quiet, steady, and deeply comforting. You walked into my life
without promises, yet somehow gave me the safest feeling I’ve ever known.<br><br>

What I admire most about you is how effortlessly you bring warmth into spaces.
Your presence calms me in ways words can’t fully explain. Even on days when life
feels overwhelming, thinking about you slows everything down. You remind me that
love doesn’t need perfection. It just needs sincerity, patience, and honesty.
You embody all three without trying.<br><br>

You have this beautiful way of listening, of understanding not just what I say
but what I feel. And in that understanding, I feel seen. Truly seen. I feel valued
in a way that makes me want to be better, not out of pressure, but out of love.
That’s a rare gift, Ankita, and you give it so naturally.<br><br>

This letter is not about grand declarations. It’s about gratitude. For you.
For the way you exist. For the calm you bring into my chaos. For being exactly
who you are. And if love is a journey, then I’m grateful that mine somehow found
its way to you.

<h2>Letter Two</h2>
<p>
Ankita,<br><br>
Sometimes I sit quietly and think about how different my days feel now.
Not because everything is perfect, but because you’re part of my world.
Your name alone brings a softness to my heart that nothing else can.
It’s strange how love doesn’t announce itself loudly. It arrives gently,
settles in slowly, and suddenly you can’t imagine life without it.<br><br>

I love the way you care. Not just in words, but in actions. The way you remember
small things. The way you worry silently. The way your kindness shows even when
no one is watching. These are the moments that make me fall for you again and
again, without effort, without doubt.<br><br>

With you, love feels patient. It feels safe. It feels like something that doesn’t
rush or demand, but simply grows. You make space for emotions instead of running
from them. You teach me, without trying, that love is about choosing someone
every single day, even on days when it’s not easy.<br><br>

If I could promise you one thing, it would be this: I will always choose you
with intention. With honesty. With respect. Because loving you is not a habit.
It’s a decision I make happily, over and over again.
</p>

<h2>Letter Three</h2>
<p>
Ankita,<br><br>
There’s something incredibly comforting about the way you exist in my life.
You don’t try to impress. You don’t try to change yourself. You’re simply you,
and that authenticity is what draws me closer every day. Loving you feels
natural, like breathing. Like something my heart always knew it needed.<br><br>

You bring balance into my life. When I overthink, you ground me. When I rush,
you remind me to slow down. When I doubt, you reassure me without saying too
much. Your presence is subtle but powerful, and I cherish that more than
anything else.<br><br>

I think love is not about constant excitement. It’s about comfort. It’s about
knowing that someone understands you, supports you, and stands beside you even
when things aren’t perfect. With you, I feel that kind of love. The kind that
lasts. The kind that grows stronger with time.<br><br>

If the future holds uncertainties, I know one thing for sure. Having you by my
side makes everything feel manageable. And that’s more than I could ever ask
for.
</p>

</div>

<div class="letter">

<h2>Letter Four</h2>
<p>
Ankita,<br><br>
I often think about how love changes us. Not by forcing us to become someone
else, but by allowing us to become more of who we truly are. With you, I feel
more open. More patient. More hopeful. You bring out parts of me I didn’t even
know existed, and for that, I’m endlessly thankful.<br><br>

Your strength inspires me. Not the loud kind, but the quiet strength that keeps
going even when things are hard. The kind that chooses kindness even when it
would be easier not to. You carry yourself with grace, and that grace reflects
in everything you do.<br><br>

I don’t love you because you complete me. I love you because you walk beside me.
Because you share this journey with me. Because you choose connection over
distance, understanding over assumptions, and love over fear.<br><br>

This letter is my way of telling you that I see you. I appreciate you. And I
value you more than words can express.
</p>

<h2>Letter Five</h2>
<p>
Ankita,<br><br>
If I had to describe what loving you feels like, I would say it feels peaceful.
Not boring. Not ordinary. Peaceful in the most beautiful sense. The kind of
peace that comes from knowing you’re not alone. The kind that stays even when
everything else feels uncertain.<br><br>

You make the idea of forever feel less intimidating and more exciting. With you,
the future doesn’t feel like a question mark. It feels like a promise waiting to
be written. I don’t know where life will take us, but I know I want to walk that
path with you, hand in hand.<br><br>

Thank you for being patient with me. For understanding me. For choosing me.
And most importantly, for being you. Loving you is one of the simplest and most
beautiful things my heart has ever known.<br><br>

Always,
Mihir
