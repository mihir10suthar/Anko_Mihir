    <h2>Letter One</h2>
    <p>
    Ankita,  
    I don’t know when it happened exactly, but somewhere between our conversations, your laughter, and the quiet moments, you became an important part of my life. Loving you didn’t arrive suddenly; it grew slowly, deeply, and naturally. You came into my world and made it feel warmer, calmer, and more meaningful.
    </p>
    <p>
    What I admire most about you is the way you care so genuinely. You don’t try to impress anyone, yet you leave an impact wherever you go. Your kindness feels effortless, and your presence makes people feel comfortable and understood. Being with you has shown me what emotional safety truly means.
    </p>
    <p>
    With you, I don’t feel the need to pretend or hide parts of myself. I can be honest, vulnerable, and real, and instead of fear, I feel acceptance. That is rare, and I treasure it more than you know. You make love feel peaceful, not overwhelming.
    </p>
    <p>
    Sometimes I sit quietly and realize how much my heart trusts you. That trust is something I will always protect. You have become someone I look forward to, someone who feels like home. And if love is a journey, I’m grateful that mine led me to you.
    </p>

    <h2>Letter Two</h2>
    <p>
    Ankita,  
    Before you, I thought love was about big gestures and perfect moments. But you taught me that love lives in the small things. A simple message, a shared smile, a moment of silence that feels comfortable instead of awkward. Loving you has changed the way I see relationships.
    </p>
    <p>
    I love how you listen. Not just to words, but to emotions. You understand feelings that aren’t spoken, and that makes me feel truly seen. When I talk to you, I never feel rushed or ignored. That kind of attention is precious, and I don’t take it lightly.
    </p>
    <p>
    You inspire me to be better without ever forcing change. Your belief in me makes me want to grow, to improve, and to become someone who deserves your love every day. You push me forward simply by being yourself.
    </p>
    <p>
    Loving you feels like choosing patience over anger, understanding over ego, and honesty over fear. I promise to always respect you, support you, and stand by you, not just on easy days, but on the difficult ones too. Because loving you is not just a feeling, it’s a commitment I make gladly.
    </p>

    <h2>Letter Three</h2>
    <p>
    Ankita,  
    There are moments when I replay our memories in my mind without realizing it. Every conversation, every laugh, every shared experience has slowly built something meaningful between us. You’ve turned ordinary days into moments I’ll always remember.
    </p>
    <p>
    What makes you special is how real everything feels with you. I don’t feel pressure to be perfect. I can show my flaws, my fears, and my doubts, and instead of judgment, I find understanding. With you, vulnerability feels safe.
    </p>
    <p>
    You bring a calmness into my life that I didn’t know I was missing. Even when things feel uncertain, your presence brings clarity. You remind me that love doesn’t have to be loud to be powerful.
    </p>
    <p>
    If I could give you one thing, it would be the ability to see yourself through my eyes. Then you would understand how deeply you are appreciated, respected, and loved. You are more than enough, exactly as you are.
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h2>Letter Four</h2>
    <p>
    Ankita,  
    Loving you has taught me patience, understanding, and gratitude. It has shown me that love is not about perfection, but about effort. About choosing each other every day, even when things aren’t easy.
    </p>
    <p>
    I admire your strength, the quiet kind that doesn’t seek attention. You handle challenges with grace and dignity, and watching that makes me respect you even more. You face life with courage, and that inspires me.
    </p>
    <p>
    I imagine a future where we grow together, learn together, and support each other’s dreams. A future built on trust, laughter, and shared goals. Not perfect, but real and honest.
    </p>
    <p>
    No matter where life takes us, I want you to know that my feelings for you are sincere. My heart has chosen you not out of habit, but out of genuine love and respect.
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h2>Letter Five</h2>
    <p>
    Ankita,  
    If love had a shape, it would look like you in my life. Calm, reassuring, and meaningful. Loving you has become part of who I am, not something I think about, but something I feel naturally.
    </p>
    <p>
    I look forward to a future where we build a life together. A life filled with shared mornings, quiet evenings, and countless memories. A life where we grow older side by side, supporting each other through every phase.
    </p>
    <p>
    Thank you for being patient with me, for understanding me, and for accepting me as I am. Thank you for choosing me and trusting me with your heart.
    </p>
    <p>
    No matter what the future holds, I want you to remember this. My love for you is steady, honest, and lasting. And every single day, I will choose you again.
    </p>
